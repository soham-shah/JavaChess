THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM JavaChess TO Bookshelf.me

# Bookshelf.me
This is a program that will be used by users in order to track which books they own. It will be able to track what they have read, are currently reading, and want to read. Bookshelf.me will also have a rating system that users can utilize to keep track of their favorite books.

#Setup
- The code is a basic maven project.
- Maven handles all the dependancies for the project so all that needs to be done is mvn build clean and it will create a jar of the project code with all the dependancies. This way we can code with multiple people and insure that we have the same dependancies.
