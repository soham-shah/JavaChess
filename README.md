THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM JavaChess TO Bookshelf.me

# Bookshelf.me
This is a program that will be used by users in order to track which books they own. It will be able to track what they have read, are currently reading, and want to read. Bookshelf.me will also have a rating system that users can utilize to keep track of their favorite books.
